### Chrome Extension

> For some reasons, I couldn't deply the extension to chrome app store, but that doesn't mean it can't be used / run locally.

#### Setting up chrome extension locally.

Simply download the `extension-directory` where it located on current github repo using the command below:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Benrobo/showwcial/tree/main/packages/showwId-ext
```

That would download the extension into a folder called `showwId-ext`.
Now, navigate to [Extension Tab](chrome://extensions/) on chrome.

> Make sure `Developer mode` is enabled. Click on `Load unpacked` button and select the directory where you previously downloaded the extension. Once that completed, it should be available to use.

#### Using the extension

Navigate to any twitter user profile which you think they have the same username as in ShowwcaseHq. for eg [https://twitter.com/heyOnuoha](https://twitter.com/heyOnuoha) has same username in showwcase, so the `ShowwcaseHq` badge should be displayed next to their username as seen below.
