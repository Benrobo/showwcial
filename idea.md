### Discord bot

User should be able to create `intent` and choose which commmunities they would love to get updates from. for eg (reactjs, nodejs, memes) etc. After selecting this communities, they could select the `tags` they would like to get updates from. After that, we create a token for each intents created which would be used to authenticate discord bot.
